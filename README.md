# Express/Passport with Angular Routing
This version uses Angular to control the login requests and redirection in coordination with client-side routing.

Important Directions:
* Run `npm install`,
* Run `grunt' in an open tab of terminal,
* Use the `client` file to work on front end files. Grunt will watch those files to be compiled into the `server/public` files. This handles minification and such.
